Here's how to build a jar with IntelliJ 10 http://blogs.jetbrains.com/idea/2010/08/quickly-create-jar-artifact/

File -> Project Structure -> Project Settings -> Artifacts -> Click green plus sign -> Jar -> From modules with dependencies...

The above sets the "skeleton" to where the jar will be saved to. To actually build and save it do the following:

****select main class which is "h2 demo"

Extract to the target Jar

OK

Build | Build Artifact



once jar is made put all csv files into its folder with the jar!

run cmd line and use cmd java -jar assurance.jar to run



to access from website use "jdbc:h2:./test" as the path !
